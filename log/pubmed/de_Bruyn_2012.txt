AB  - Killer whales, Orcinus orca, are top predators occupying key ecological roles in 
      a variety of ecosystems and are one of the most widely distributed mammals on the
      planet. In consequence, there has been significant interest in understanding
      their basic biology and ecology. Long-term studies of Northern Hemisphere killer 
      whales, particularly in the eastern North Pacific (ENP), have identified three
      ecologically distinct communities or ecotypes in that region. The success of
      these prominent ENP studies has led to similar efforts at clarifying the role of 
      killer whale ecology in other regions, including Antarctica. In the Southern
      Hemisphere, killer whales present a range of behavioural, social and
      morphological characteristics to biologists, who often interpret this as evidence
      to categorize individuals or groups, and draw general ecological conclusions
      about these super-predators. Morphologically distinct forms (Type A, B, C, and D)
      occur in the Southern Ocean and studies of these different forms are often
      presented in conjunction with evidence for specialised ecology and behaviours.
      Here we review current knowledge of killer whale ecology and ecotyping globally
      and present a synthesis of existing knowledge. In particular, we highlight the
      complexity of killer whale ecology in the Southern Hemisphere and examine this in
      the context of comparatively well-studied Northern Hemisphere populations. We
      suggest that assigning erroneous or prefatory ecotypic status in the Southern
      Hemisphere could be detrimental to subsequent killer whale studies, because
      unsubstantiated characteristics may be assumed as a result of such
      classification. On this basis, we also recommend that ecotypic status
      classification for Southern Ocean killer whale morphotypes be reserved until more
      evidence-based ecological and taxonomic data are obtained.
