AB  - Over the past five decades, marine mammal interactions with fisheries have become
      a major human-wildlife conflict globally. The emergence of longline fishing is
      concomitant with the development of depredation-type interactions i.e., marine
      mammals feeding on fish caught on hooks. The killer whale (Orcinus orca) is one
      of the species most involved in depredation on longline fisheries. The issue was 
      first reported in high latitudes but, with increasing expansion of this fishing
      method, other fisheries have begun to experience interactions. The present study 
      investigated killer whale interactions with two geographically isolated blue-eye 
      trevalla (Hyperoglyphe antarctica) fisheries operating in temperate waters off
      Amsterdam/St. Paul Islands (Indian Ocean) and south-eastern Australia. These two 
      fisheries differ in the fishing technique used (vertical vs. demersal longlines),
      effort, catch, fleet size and fishing area size. Using 7-year (2010-16) long
      fishing and observation datasets, this study estimated the levels of killer whale
      interactions and examined the influence of spatio-temporal and operational
      variables on the probability of vessels to experience interactions. Killer whales
      interactions occurred during 58.4% and 21.2% of all fishing days, and over 94%
      and 47.4% of the fishing area for both fisheries, respectively. In south-eastern 
      Australia, the probability of occurrence of killer whale interactions during
      fishing days varied seasonally with a decrease in spring, increased with the
      daily fishing effort and decreased with the distance travelled by the vessel
      between fishing days. In Amsterdam/St. Paul, this probability was only influenced
      by latitude, with an increase in the southern part of the area. Together, these
      findings document two previously unreported cases of high killer whale
      depredation, and provide insights on ways to avoid the issue. The study also
      emphasizes the need to further examine the local characteristics of fisheries and
      the ecology of local depredating killer whale populations in as important drivers
      of depredation.
