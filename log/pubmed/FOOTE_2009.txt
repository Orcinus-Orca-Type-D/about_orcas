TI  - Ecological, morphological and genetic divergence of sympatric North Atlantic
      killer whale populations.
PG  - 5207-17
AB  - Ecological divergence has a central role in speciation and is therefore an
      important source of biodiversity. Studying the micro-evolutionary processes of
      ecological diversification at its early stages provides an opportunity for
      investigating the causative mechanisms and ecological conditions promoting
      divergence. Here we use morphological traits, nitrogen stable isotope ratios and 
      tooth wear to characterize two disparate types of North Atlantic killer whale. We
      find a highly specialist type, which reaches up to 8.5 m in length and a
      generalist type which reaches up to 6.6 m in length. There is a single fixed
      genetic difference in the mtDNA control region between these types, indicating
      integrity of groupings and a shallow divergence. Phylogenetic analysis indicates 
      this divergence is independent of similar ecological divergences in the Pacific
      and Antarctic. Niche-width in the generalist type is more strongly influenced by 
      between-individual variation rather than within-individual variation in the
      composition of the diet. This first step to divergent specialization on different
      ecological resources provides a rare example of the ecological conditions at the 
      early stages of adaptive radiation.
